Stage 1: Basic NodeJS Application
In this stage, I created a simple NodeJS application that returns my favorite programming language when accessed.

## Instructions
1. Create a NodeJS application on port 3000 that will return your favorite programming language.
2. Don't forget to add a comment at the bottom of your code about the command you used to run your NodeJS application.

## Running the Application
To run the NodeJS application, I used the following command:
node app.js

After running the above command, you should see a message indicating that the application is running on port 3000. 
You can then access it by opening a web browser and visiting http://localhost:3000.
